# Grip_Project1
In this project , we are given a small dataset with one independent variable and we have to fit a supervised learning model.

The dependent variable is **Scores**.<br/>
The independent variable is **Hours**.

The data has 25 entries.

### Objective: To fit a linear regression model for predicting scores based on hours.
 
### What we have done?
* Checked the trend in the scatter plot of the data.
* Calculated the pearson coefficient of correlation between y and x.
* Basic univariate analysis(checking for outliers in variables) done.
* Train test split done and fitting of linear regression model.
* Prediction on test data 
* Checking the model accuracy using r squared and MSE.

The linear regression model has R^2 of 97% approximately and the MSE is equal to 3.965.
